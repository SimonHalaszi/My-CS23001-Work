// Lab on dynamic memory
//
// Memory allocation and array bounds checking
//
// C/C++ does not check array bounds, so accessing an element of an
//    array outside of its defined size results in Undefined Behavior
//
// TO COMPILE: clang++ -Wall array_bounds_check.cpp -o bounds_check
// TO RUN: ./bounds_check
//           Then enter a postivie integer value at the prompt
//
// Instructions:
//   Read the code.
//   Run the program on wasp/hornet (multiple) times.
//   Try these values of 10, 16, 32, 33, 40
//
//   Read over the output each time.
//
//   What is wrong with the output?
//      -The output puts out junk data at large numbers n.
//
//   What is wrong with the code?
//      -The code is writing data to the pointer at indexes
//       that may not have been allocated to it on the heap.
//
//   Why is no error raised?
//      Because as state C++ doesnt check to see if your in the bounds
//
//   How many bytes are between the start of str1 and str2?
//      -0x8 memory addresses. So there is Eight between them.
//
//   How can you test for this logical error?
//      -Using Valgrind. Or by making assertions while coding that wont
//       let you do this.
//
//   How can you prevent this type of error?
//      -By deleting all memory allocated to the heap when it is no longer needed.
//       And by making sure that all writing and reading you do to a dynamic array
//       is within the bounds of the memory allocated to it.
//
//   Include the delete[] at the end and recompile, what changes?
//      -If there is a delete[] valgrind will report that 0 bytes
//       were lost and that all memory was release. If there is no
//       delete than Valgrind will report 25 bytes in 2 blocks as
//       lost.
//
