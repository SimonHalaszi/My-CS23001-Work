The amount of trailing zeros in a given positive integer n is equal to x,
where x is the largest number in the set of whole numbers in which 
the result of (n / 10^x) is in the set of positive integers

(Set of whole numbers defined here as set of positive integers + 0)

n ∈ Z+
x ∈ W

largest x for which:
(n / 10^x) ∈ Z+

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Example: n = 23457000

23457000 / 10^0 = 23457000

23457000 ∈ Z+

23457000 / 10^1 = 2345700

2345700 ∈ Z+

23457000 / 10^2 = 234570

234570 ∈ Z+

23457000 / 10^3 = 23457

23457 ∈ Z+

23457000 / 10^4 = 2345.7 

2345.7 ∉ Z+

Therefore 23457000 has 3 trailing zeros.
